# Thesis Project: Controller Generation from Natural Language

This repository contains the code developed as part of my thesis project. The goal of this project is to generate controllers from natural language specifications using formal methods and natural language processing techniques.

## Features
- Parse natural language inputs to extract specifications.
- Translate specifications into formal representations.
- Generate controllers based on the formalized specifications.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ltl-generation.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
